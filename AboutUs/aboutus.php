					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<hr color="#d91448">
					<p>We aim to create the best cakes, cookies, pastry and more since 1994. Our CEO Parlusin started baking at a very young age, and her recipes she got from her grandmother. Her little hobby grew into production and now thousands of people enjoy Parlusin's pastry.</p>
					<p>We've been exporting our products since 2003, and in 2010 we opened our first bakery in the USA. Now we have bakeries in 6 countries: Armenia, the US, South Korea, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. Our head office address is 26 Pushkin str., Yerevan, Armenia. Contact us any time!</p>
